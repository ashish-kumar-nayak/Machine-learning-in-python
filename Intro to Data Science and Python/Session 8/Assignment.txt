A survey was taken of U.S. companies that do business with firms in India. One of
the questions on the survey was: Approximately how many years has your company

question is 7.7 years. Using this information, construct a 90% confidence interval for
the mean number of years that a company has been trading in India for the population
of U.S. companies trading with firms in India.
