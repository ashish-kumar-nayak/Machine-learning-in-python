A cellular telephone company is rethinking its pricing structure. Users appear to be 
spending more time on the phone and are shopping around for the best deals. 
To do better planning, the cellular company wants to ascertain the average number of 
minutes of time used per month by each of its residential users but does not have 
the resources available to examine all monthly bills and extract the information. 
The company decides to take a sample of customer bills and estimate the population 
mean from sample data. A researcher for the company takes a random sample of 85 bills 
for a recent month and from these bills computes a sample mean of 510 minutes. 
Using this information, construct a 95% confidence interval for the average length
of a call for the population. Suppose past history and similar studies
indicate that the population standard deviation is 46 minutes.

Suppose a Ola Cabs wants to estimate the average number of Kilometers traveled per day 
by each of its cars rented in Bengaluru. A random sample of 20 cars rented in Bengaluru 
reveals that the sample mean travel distance per day is 85.5 Kilometers, with a population 
standard deviation of 19.3 Kilometers. Assuming the population is normally distributed,
Compute a 99% confidence interval to estimate .
