Suppose that during any hour in a large department store, the average number of
shoppers is 448, with a standard deviation of 21 shoppers. What is the probability
that a random sample of 49 different shopping hours will yield a sample mean
between 441 and 446 shoppers?

Suppose 60% of the electrical contractors in a region use a particular brand of wire.
What is the probability of taking a random sample of size 120 from these electrical contractors
