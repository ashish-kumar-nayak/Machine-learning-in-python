In an attempt to determine why customer service is important to managers in the United Kingdom, 
researchers surveyed managing directors of manufacturing plants in Scotland.
One of the reasons proposed was that customer service is a means of retaining customers.
On a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being low and 5 being high, the
survey respondents rated this reason more highly than any of the others, with a mean
response of 4.30. Suppose U.S. researchers believe American manufacturing managers
would not rate this reason as highly and conduct a hypothesis test to prove their theory.
Alpha is set at .05. Based on the data gathered from 32 managers, the sample average of the responses is 4.156. 
Perform a hypothesis testing to determine whether U.S. managers rate
this reason significantly lower than the 4.30 mean.
Assume from previous studies that the population standard deviation is 0.574.


Figures released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture show that the average size
of farms has increased since 1940. In 1940, the mean size of a farm was 174 acres;
by 1997, the average size was 471 acres. Suppose an agribusiness researcher believes 
the average size of farms has now increased from the 1997 mean figure of 471 acres. 
To test this notion, she randomly sampled 23 farms across the United States and 
ascertained the size of each farm from county records.The resulting sample average is 498.78 acres
and the sample standard deviation is 46.94 acres. Use a 5% level of significance to test her hypothesis. 
Assume that number of acres per farm is normally distributed in the population.
