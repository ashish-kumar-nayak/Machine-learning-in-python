According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average weekly earnings of a
production worker in 1997 were $424.20. Suppose a labor researcher wants to test to
determine whether this figure is still accurate today. The researcher randomly selects
54 production workers from across the United States and obtains a representative
earnings statement for one week from each. The resulting sample average is $432.69.
Assuming a population standard deviation of $33.90, and a 5% level of significance,
determine whether the mean weekly earnings of a production worker have changed.
